# End Nuh Uh

Want to stop the end from happening in a simple way? This is the mod for you!

End Nuh Uh is a simple way to prevent players from going to the end.

## How does it work?

The mod prevents players in survival mod from placing eyes in the portal, when try to do so it plays a sound and
spawns some particles to indicate that they can't do that.
This limitation is not applied to creative players, if you need to create a portal in general.

A second thing this mod adds is the ability to remove eyes from the frames. To do so you simply need to sneak and
right-click on the frame with an empty hand, which will drop the eye on top of the frame
(Note. It doesn't spawn the item in creative).

## Future plans

There are plans to let player place the eyes it but prevent the portal from being opened or only prevent the last eye
from being inserted.

Also, I do plan to add events to allow other mods to let stop the prevention or do something else after the prevention
has happened.
